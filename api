The Jerry Hadley production is also worth watching, especially for him. Of the three, this ranks as a close second. It is let down by the some stagnant stage directing- though there are also a fair share of compelling moments like with the boxing match and Jimmy's execution- with people standing in lines with not a lot of interaction, even in intimate scenes. And the chorus were not easy to hear sometimes. The updated setting works though, there is an admirable attempt to make it relevant to today's audiences while not trivialising too much the satire and political themes of Weill's very interesting and structurally unique opera(though some of the music for me is appreciate rather than love quality). The costumes and sets are kept simple but are never ugly. The orchestral playing is lush and stylish, and the conducting is rhythmically driven yet allows solos like the Alabama Song have space without sentimentalising it too much. The chorus are motivated enough and while not always clear they sing with vibrancy. Audra McDonald is sensational, she is sexy, sings like an angel and is energetic and moving, though Teresa Stratas brings more of a tragic quality. Patti LuPone is rather metallic at the top but most of her voice is rich and is both grotesque and funny, a very larger-than-life performance. Anthony Dean Giffrey's voice is controlled and has no problem being heard, he brings a boyishness and elegance which is impressive for one with so imposing a figure and he is very emotive, I actually prefer his Jimmy to his Peter Grimes personally. Robert Worle brings a lot of colour and character to Fatty and Donnie Ray Albert is a menacing Moses. All secondary roles are well taken.

The updated setting works though, there is an admirable attempt to make it relevant to today's audiences while not trivialising too much the satire and political themes of Weill's very interesting and structurally unique opera(though some of the music for me is appreciate rather than love quality). The costumes and sets are kept simple but are never ugly. The orchestral playing is lush and stylish, and the conducting is rhythmically driven yet allows solos like the Alabama Song have space without sentimentalising it too much. The chorus are motivated enough and while not always clear they sing with vibrancy. Audra McDonald is sensational, she is sexy, sings like an angel and is energetic and moving, though Teresa Stratas brings more of a tragic quality. Patti LuPone is rather metallic at the top but most of her voice is rich and is both grotesque and funny, a very larger-than-life performance. Anthony Dean Giffrey's voice is controlled and has no problem being heard, he brings a boyishness and elegance which is impressive for one with so imposing a figure and he is very emotive, I actually prefer his Jimmy to his Peter Grimes personally. Robert Worle brings a lot of colour and character to Fatty and Donnie Ray Albert is a menacing Moses. All secondary roles are well taken. Overall, a mostly very good production though a lot of it from a musical standpoint, of the three DVD productions seen this is second to the Met's. 8\/10 Bethany Cox","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"English","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007\/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007\/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007\/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007\/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007\/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/060917BB4E0B2A7E31EA0C29517FAC2076CEE51A","hash":"060917BB4E0B2A7E31EA0C29517FAC2076CEE51A","quality":"720p","type":"web","seeds":42,"peers":22,"size":"1.24 GB","size_bytes":1331439862,"date_uploaded":"2020-07-18 04:56:56","date_uploaded_unix":1595041016},{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/F9CE8E999515575DEADF4313264AC8A63E4B4290","hash":"F9CE8E999515575DEADF4313264AC8A63E4B4290","quality":"1080p","type":"web","seeds":38,"peers":37,"size":"2.29 GB","size_bytes":2458868777,"date_uploaded":"2020-07-18 08:55:41","date_uploaded_unix":1595055341}],"date_uploaded":"2020-07-18 04:56:56","date_uploaded_unix":1595041016},{"id":19366,"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/movies\/luciano-mellera-infantiloide-2018","imdb_code":"tt7607400","title":"Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide","title_english":"Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide","title_long":"Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide (2018)","slug":"luciano-mellera-infantiloide-2018","year":2018,"rating":8.5,"runtime":66,"genres":["Comedy"],"summary":"Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.","description_full":"Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.","synopsis":"Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"English","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018\/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018\/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018\/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018\/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018\/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/EDE6B5B69411C5574DD76E40CA548ED6CD1380F0","hash":"EDE6B5B69411C5574DD76E40CA548ED6CD1380F0","quality":"720p","type":"web","seeds":46,"peers":26,"size":"606.96 MB","size_bytes":636443689,"date_uploaded":"2020-07-17 14:35:02","date_uploaded_unix":1594989302},{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/5DB28F684899A2A902DC05A982184FA76099A801","hash":"5DB28F684899A2A902DC05A982184FA76099A801","quality":"1080p","type":"web","seeds":59,"peers":28,"size":"1.22 GB","size_bytes":1309965025,"date_uploaded":"2020-07-17 15:55:46","date_uploaded_unix":1594994146}],"date_uploaded":"2020-07-17 14:35:02","date_uploaded_unix":1594989302},{"id":19365,"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/movies\/pizza-beer-and-cigarettes-1998","imdb_code":"tt0145393","title":"Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes","title_english":"Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes","title_long":"Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes (1998)","slug":"pizza-beer-and-cigarettes-1998","year":1998,"rating":7.1,"runtime":92,"genres":["Crime","Drama"],"summary":"A couple of friends work for a taxi driver to rob his passengers, but they feel like they're getting ripped off.
